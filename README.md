# polyton
A helper to deal with singletons

## Usage

A Polyton is an ordered list of singletons, and is itself a singleton, so that you can create and manage singletons straightforwardly.

```PolytonFactory``` takes 3 arguments. The first one is a Type constructor for all the underlying singletons. The second one is an array of hints for the types of arguments that will be used to create the singletons (or a function generating a unique key for different set of arguments, the hints being just used to generate such a function internaly). The third one is optional, as it can reconstructed from the second one in most cases. Nevertheless, it must be used when for example the order of the arguments for the Polyton doesn't matter.

In the following example, 3 plane equations are created as singletons in one go. They are grouped as a Polyton in a specific order.

```js
import {PolytonFactory} from 'polyton';

class PlaneEquation { // Type for all the singletons within the Polyton
  constructor(a, b, c, d) {
    this.a = a;
    this.b = b;
    this.c = c;
    this.d = d;
  }
  hasPoint(x, y, z) {
    return Math.abs(this.a * x + this.b * y + this.c * z + this.d) < 1e-10;
  }
}

const Polyton = PolytonFactory(PlaneEquation, ['literal', 'literal', 'literal', 'literal']);
// Create a Polyton type as list of PlaneEquations initialized from lists of literals

const planes = Polyton( // Instantiate an actual polyton
  [0, 0, 1, 0], // xOy
  [0, 1, 0, 0], // xOz
  [1, 0, 0, 0], // yOz
);
const Origin = [0, 0, 0];

// Now you can recall plane equations using only the arguments though they
// are not in scope

planes.get(1, 0, 0, 0).hasPoint(...Origin); // true
planes.get(0, 1, 0, 0).hasPoint(...Origin); // true
planes.get(0, 0, 1, 0).hasPoint(...Origin); // true
planes.get(1, 0, 0, 3).hasPoint(...Origin); // throws, undefined equation

Polyton.get(
  [0, 0, 1, 0], // xOy
  [0, 1, 0, 0], // xOz
  [1, 0, 0, 0], // yOz
) === planes; // true
Polyton.get(
  [1, 0, 0, 0], // yOz
  [0, 1, 0, 0], // xOz
  [0, 0, 1, 0], // xOy
) !== planes; // true
```

## PolytonFactory API

* ```PolytonFactory(Class, classSingletonOptions, basePolytonSingletonOptions, basePolytonOptions)```: Returns a ```Polyton``` constructor that will generate singletons of class ```Class```. ```classSingletonOptions``` indicates how to process the initializing arguments for each singletons. See package [keyfunc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyfunc) for a detailed discussion on how to present this argument.
* ```basePolytonSingletonOptions``` is optional and is used when the polytons themselves must be indexed in a special way. By default, polytons are just referenced by an array of all the arguments that were used to create the singletons it contains.
* Last argument ```basePolytonOptions``` is also optional and is used to extend the ```BasePolyton``` prototype: it is an object with property 'extend' containing all new (or to be overridden) method declarations. It can also have property 'preprocess'. In such a case, the arguments passed to the Polyton are preprocessed before being passed to individual underlying Singletons. This helps a lot keeping a clean indexing. To add properties to instances, use option 'properties'.

##  Instance Polyton API

* ```Polyton(...args)```: Creates a Polyton from a list of arrays of arguments. Each array contains the arguments to create an invidual underlying singleton.
* ```prototype.length```: Returns the number of singletons within the polyton.
* ```prototype.elements```: Returns a copy of the array of singletons within the polyton.
* ```prototype.at(n)```: Returns nth singleton within the polyton.
* ```prototype.get(...args)```: ```args``` are the arguments from which some singleton was initialized; this method returns the corresponding singleton.
* ```prototype.forEach(func)```: Loops over all singletons within the polyton.
* ```prototype.map(func)```: Returns an array mapping all singletons within the polyton with the function ```func```.
* ```prototype.reduce(func)```: Returns the reduced value obtained from reducing the array of singletons within the polyton with function func.
* ```prototype.concat(...args)```: Returns the concatenated Polyton from args. Args as already existing Polytons is allowed.

## Static Polyton API

```get(...args)```: Given the arguments tha twere used to create it, returns the corresponding polyton.
